# 1 Introduction

The objective of this lab is to give students an experience in understanding and developing unit testing suites. This is done through several methods of classes provided in JFreeChart System, where the team builds several tests by implementing black box testing design. Through this, the team will determine input variables, and from that, systematically design tests around it. It is important to test boundary conditions as it ensures all system inputs.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

In this lab exercise, a variety of test strategies were implemented. These included blackbox testing, boundary test, and utilization of equivalence classes. We also used mocking in order to test methods that take in interfaces as parameters. When testing in range, many classes do not take in input values, but instead rely on variables.
The methods of testing we used for testing the class Range were boundary value analysis, and equivalent classes. During the testing of the upper and lower bounds, we used boundary value analysis. We tested values above the bounds and under the bounds for both the upper and lower bounds. For example for the upper bound, we tested values right above the range bound, and right inside of the range bound. Using equivalent classes, we identified the independent variables and then determined the number of distinct partitions for each variable, and created test cases from that.
However for cases where input does matter, methods of attempting to cover all possible equivalence classes are done by testing inputs. When testing data utilities, implementing some methods from range, determine the equivalence class, and test using inputs, variables, and boundaries. Classes such as in createNumberArray(), values of positives, negatives and both values ranging from negative to positive were tested. Invalid inputs were also tested.
The benefits of mocking are that it allows us to test the system independently without relying on another class to fulfill the objects we’re testing. It allows for isolation of the system so when a dependent class is unavailable, the system can still be tested. The drawbacks to mocking is that creating a mockery takes more time and effort in order to test methods, and can become overwhelming when testing large systems. As well as when using mock objects they can sometimes provide the wrong answers, so when you actually deploy the system it won’t work as intended, therefore providing false confidence in your system.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Work/team effort was divided equally between the 4 group members. The team first familiarize ourselves with the system and tools being used to test it. We then came up tests for a method with the Range class and DataUtilities class. Afterwards we all wrote tests for an additional method for each of the classes. After writing the tests, we analyzed and discussed the results, seeing which tests failed and succeeded.
# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Some difficulties we encountered during this lab was insufficient experience and knowledge regarding mocking. This prevented us from fully testing all of our equivalence classes and unit tests that we could think of since we did not know how we would be able to implement them with mocking. Another difficulty we experienced was being unfamiliar with the classes being tested and vague information regarding the Javadoc documentation. This added some confusion regarding behavior during testing which caused errors.
# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

	Overall, this lab exercise is interesting and educational, providing a good learning experience and understanding into designing, creating unit tests, and black box testing. Instructions were clear, the background information and diagrams provided, helped gain better understanding of the purpose and the instructions. The fact that the classes had random intentional defects added confusion to the lab as it made it unclear if the class had a defect or if we were implementing the test incorrectly.
